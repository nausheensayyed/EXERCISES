# EXERCISES
## EXERCISE 1

#### Fizz-Buzz: Write a program that will print numbers from 1 to 30, with the following exceptions that when the number is divisible by 3, the word “Fizz” is printed instead of the number, and when the number is divisible by 5, the word “Buzz” is printed instead of the number, and when the number is divisible by by both 3 and 5, then the word “FizzBuzz” is printed instead of the number. 
##### a. Write the output sequence of what the output will look like
##### b. Write the algorithm for delivering the output
##### c. Write the program that follows the algorithm
### SOLUTIONS
a. 1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz Fizz 17 Fizz 19 Buzz Fizz 22 23 Fizz Buzz 26 Fizz 28 29 FizzBuzz  

b. 
Start
STEP 1.
Initialize n=1

STEP 2.
a) if (number is divisible by 3 and 5)
	then print "FizzBuzz", Go to STEP3
b) if (number is divisible by 3)
	then print "Fizz", Go to STEP3
c) if (number is divisible by 5)
	then print "Buzz", Go to STEP3
d )print n

STEP 3. 
Increment n by 1 (n++) 
if n<=30 Go to Step 2
else stop

c. 
Program:
 
	int main()
	{

    int i;
    for (i=1; i<=100; i++)
    {
       
        if ((i%3 == 0) && (i%5 == 0))       
            printf ("FizzBuzz\t");   
         
        
        else if ((i%3) == 0)   
            printf("Fizz\t");                
         
      
        else if ((i%5) == 0)                      
            printf("Buzz\t");                
     
        else           
            printf("%d\t", i);                
 
    }
 
    return 0;
    
	}
